### `Development details`

yarn was utilized over npm for as yarn is:

Fast: Yarn caches every package it downloads so it never needs to again. It also parallelizes operations to maximize resource utilization so install times are faster than ever.

Reliable: Using a detailed, but concise, lockfile format, and a deterministic algorithm for installs, Yarn is able to guarantee that an install that worked on one system will work exactly the same way on any other system.

Secure: Yarn uses checksums to verify the integrity of every installed package before its code is executed.

Material UI was chosen as the component library to use components usage

The application is written in TypeScript as it provides the following:

- Class and Module Support
- Static Type-checking
- ES6 Feature Support
- Clear Library API Definition
- Build-in Support for JavaScript Packaging
- Superset of JavaScript

Styling is made with 3 different ways to showcase my styling abilities:

- Sass
- Styled Components
- CSS modules
